# Pain-and-Suffering
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November - December 2021

## Theme
Since the phrase "pick your poison" evokes such a defeatist, melancholy feeling, our main motivation for our game was to mimic that sentiment. In order to better communicate that emotion in a thorough manner, we opted to produce a narrative-based game akin to our first assigned project. 

## Game Play
The main objective of the game is to complete the given riddles while under great pressure, culminating in the ultimate choice: do you choose selfishness and sacrifice another's life for your lonesome continued existence, or do you make a major personal sacrifice and choose selflessness, sparing the life of your insidious ally who would be missed by his whole community?

## Impediments
The main impediments encountered along the way were related to time management and the reality of time constraints. We had a good amount of ideas about potential game features (ASCII art, a countdown timer function, puzzles, dialogue boxes, NPCs, etc), but we had to really reel ourselves in to make sure we had a solid foundation before venturing into "what-if" territory. Realizing that sooner would've aided in our project's completion timeline for sure.

## Implementation
Built using Visual Studio Code, Twine 2.3.14, and Python 3.9.6
